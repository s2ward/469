I personally no longer believe that decryption is the way.

But will keep this up for anyone interested.  

# DNA Alignment analysis

I've used Biochemistry libraries with python to create sequence analysis to better find standalone numbers.  
It's usually used for DNA sequence research.  
It gives some very interesting data for 469, see [alignments](./dna_alignment_analysis/alignment_analysis/markdown/)

# 469

469 is a language found in Tibia. Created in 2001, it's about 21 years old and still have not been solved.  
469 is spoken between bonelords, a blob with 5 eyes. This is performed by blinking numbers.

Excerpt from a book in Tibia: [Beware of the Bonelords](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Beware_of_the_Bonelords_(Book))  

> The bonelords are an ancient race of underground dwelling necromancers. Although they can 'speak' like humans using some membranes, their native 'tongue' consists of a blinking code with each eye, where a blinking could mean some syllable, letter or word. It is by far the most complex speech we have ever encountered and it is almost impossible to comprehend. As far as we can tell it is not only a language but also some kind of mathematics. This combination makes it tedious even to try to understand that language.  
> The books the bonelords write contain only numbers and the code behind them is incredibly complex. This race was one of those which were part in the creation wars and therefore its peak of civilization and power is long gone. There are rumours about still existent bonelord settlements where they try to improve their unspeakable necromantic rituals and create an army of undead.

The main city of the current bonelords, Hellgate - contains a library holding 71 books, all in numbers. See books [here](01-books.md) where each line contains one book.  
Here we meet A Wrinkled Bonelord, the librarian. We can talk to it to get more information.

Here I have collected all clues I think we need to solve 469.

I start off by showing you what we can find in-game, and further down I will show you some of my thoughts.

- [00-timeline.md](00-timeline.md) 469 history in chronological order (by [elkolorado](https://github.com/elkolorado))
- [01-books.md](01-books.md) contains the books we find on 469.
- [02-align.txt](02-align.txt): aligned with repeats (by Trikki Rikki)
- [03-align.txt](03-align.txt): aligned in slightly longer sequences (continued by me)
- [04-align.txt](04-align.txt): close to being a full sequence. (50~ hours in)
- [05-rearrange.txt](05-rearrange.txt) we carefully start rearranging some books.

If you are on mobile you might want to disable line-wrapping, otherwise the .txt will look like jibberish to you.

## Can we blink it?

Mathemagic is used in Paradox tower quest. In this quest we learn the secrets of mathmagics by the mad mage.  
Paradox tower also contain a direct teleport to Hellgate.

Mathemagic:

1 + 1 = 1  
1 + 1 = 13  
1 + 1 = 49  
1 + 1 = 94  

This sequence appears in tetranacci sequence.

A pattern can be found, each time the number on the left column increases, the number on the right column increases.  
This is true for 26/28 "pairs". This means that the numbers are in a deliberate sequence. And the value of "X" can be quite reliably estimated.

The number on the left seems to be 1.5x~ of that on the number to the right.  
I think this is why they tried to hide some of the numbers on the right with the clay-figure.

As the numbers are mirrored, it could be a reference that when bonelords talk/blink, they see the other 'blink' the numbers mirrored.  
There is also a mirrored room in paradox tower of 469s creator, this room contains books that *could* be the cipher for 469.

## Demona & honeminas formula

Warlocks of Demona had a bonelord called '[honeminas](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Honeminas_Formula_(Book))' who created formulae for understanding the magic web.

```
(Note: g stands for gate, g [a_,x_] for the coordinates of the gate in the 2-dimensional-area and e for the strengh of the magic energy that flows into this gate.

For all other formulas look in your collection of formulas)

g[a_,x_] := a g[3,2] + (4,3,1,5,3).(3,4,7,8,4)
e=3m*2g+3p
```

Where:

- 4315 appears in the books, 431 maybe appear in facebook post. 43153 does not appear in books.

- 3478 appears in the books, is said by Knightmare NPC, and is the name of a nostaliga bonelord. *could* translate into 'beholder'.

- Each section (1,2,3,4,5).(1,2,3,4,5) contains five numbers. One number for each eye when 'blinking' it?

What does the fifth number do, and why does it not appear in the bonelord books?  
It could be an important number for understanding 469.

This, in itself looks like the dot product of two vectors, talking of coordinates on a 2-dimensional plane.

There are more formulae in [Demona Library](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Demona_Library)

| :exclamation:  Notice!   |
|-----------------------------------------|
Notice how these numbers are in pairs, exactly like in the facebook post.. where 43153 (the left number) is bigger than the right number 34783

## Secret Library book

```
74032 45331 
```

Notice again, how these came in pairs, with left number being bigger than the right number. (honeminas formula looks crucial)

## Plotting the pairs

Interesting properties of 469 can be [shown](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nx3eDaaP8i2hIbYQc6vEVzR72mxhlviJ?usp=sharing)

Cip has again and again thrown hints that 469 comes in pairs, with left number being bigger than right number.. for example: (11, 7)

- this is seen in their facebook post
- this is seen in honeminas formula (43151 34783)
- this is seen in the latest 469 book in secret library (74032 45331)

Plotting the pairs from facebook post shows that all of them follow a pattern, otherwise the dots would not be close to the line on picture.  
The only pair that is not plotting like the other pairs is (1280, 625), and this is the only pair where the left number ends with a 0. 
 
 Each pair is processed liked (x, y), and each dot represents one pair.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25346191/160277492-d4f8b499-ecc6-4051-93eb-16389c64e080.png)

> Player: 0  
> a wrinkled bonelord: Go and wash your eyes for using this obscene number!

Looking further at the 0, we also have two pairs where the right number is 447.  
- A: (706, 447)  
- B: (689, 447)

706 is bigger than 689, but 706 contains a zero.

This seems to suggest that multiplication is involved - which makes sense when we also consider that in honeminas formula, the digits are processed indepentendly: (4,3,1,5,3).(3,4,7,8,4)  

Two other interesting pairs are:

- A: (652, 400)  
- B: (653, 407)

When '2' -> '3', right number goes up by 7.
 
- A: (1017, 658)  
- B: (1021, 659)  

How does that emerge?

How are these numbers 'decided'? What's the math behind them?

## My thoughts

Something has to be done to numbers that comes in pairs (be it dot product of vectors as in honeminas formula or smth else)  
This then could give something that indicates a letter on the jibberish books. (e.g. something along the lines of 4th row, 2nd column, 3rd letter...)

We also see in 04-align.txt that the sequences found in hellgate library seems to be just one large sequence that you can puzzle together.  
It looks like the creator of 469 and the hellgate books have scrambled some books to cause entropy, it also looks like a single number has been removed in a handful of the books - making all previous bruteforce attempts invalid. (seen in example of 05-rearrange.txt)

With one book (vs 71) we can more easily find patterns in 'the sequence'.

We can also see what has been done to the books - some have been scrambled good, while others have just been halved and switched sides.  
In 04-align.txt, no book has been rearranged. In 05-rearrange.txt - I show an example on how some books are rearranged and that in some books, a single digit has been exchanged.  
I also show how to systematically rearrange the books while ensuring that we don't change the outcome of the final long sequence.

## Testing on your own

I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then i highlight a sequence to see where other occurences appear.  
I use CTRL + F to search a sequence to highlight and lock it in while i highlight other sequences with the cursor. This allows me to keep track of what i'm doing.  
Any sequence on the same line within [brackets] are a sequence within that line that appears in other lines. This is used to keep track of sequences.
 
Here i have ctrl+f a sequnce appearing in orange, and highlighted a sequence that appear in grey.
